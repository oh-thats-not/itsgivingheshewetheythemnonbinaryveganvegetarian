Not only is she kinda cute, but she's also down-to-earth and had me GEEKINg. We shared some dope conversations over dinner, and she really knows how to keep things flowing.

    <p>"Hands down best bday of my life with Diana. She was just as cool in person as I had imagined. She's got this perfect mix of suave and joie de vivre and when it comes to the DANCE floor ma'am it's game over. We had an fun and yappy dinner, and the conversation flowed so naturally. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday-she knows how to pull out all the stops i'll tell you that much. 10/10 reccommend"</p>

    <p>"Just wrapped up an amazing birthday celebration with Diana! It was good vibes from the get go. We had so many laughs, and the conversation was effortless. She's lowkey funny af. Our time together flew by, and I can't wait to see her again. If you get through the approval process, don't hesitateâ€”she does not dissapoint and if she does she offers a full refund"</p>
